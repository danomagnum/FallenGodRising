The very existance of a god is wholly reliant on their connection to the mortal world.
Some gods have talismans.  Some embed themselves deep in the ground. An unluckky few hold on only in stories.

Some wage war.

You are a minor god who has nearly been purged out by a greedy competitor, they've drained you
of most of your power. Before they could finish you off, you slipped into the shadows with your last
remaining soldiers.


You must take revenge on the god who attempted to displace you.  Go to the stronghold where
the followers of this cruel adversary have the gods talisman stored and destroy it.

Just don't lose your link to the world in the process.

In your weakend state, you only have the capacity to possess three mortals.
Once possessed, a mortal remains possessed until they perish.  When a spot has opened up, you
can attempt to possess any other creature you come in contact with.

The weaker the creature is when you attempt to gain possession of them the more likely you are
to succeed.  Failing a possession attempt reduces the likelyhood that you will be successfull
on subsuquent attempts.
