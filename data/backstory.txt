In the beginning there was a single being known only as "the one great god" or "the one". The one created the world and all its inhabitants. 

After some time, it created holy alters spread out throught the land.  These alters provided the worlds creatures with a place to worship and give thanks to the one.

Growing tired of the day-to-day, the one embued each of the alters with its own minor god.  These minor gods would develop their powers over the millenia and become the 
predominant forces in the world.

Eventually, very few mortals remembered the one.  Displeased, it began altering the status quo of existance.  This understandably did not go over well 
with the minor gods.  The powers they had worked to develop being contested for the first time.

The minor gods rose up in mutany against the one and after a fierce battle, managed to seal it away.

Of the many skills the minor gods devloped, none were ever able to obtain the ability to create.  In turn, as alters fell to decay, war, and sabotage, the number of gods left in the 
world dwindled.  At present, only 8 remain.

You are a god with the power of possession and your alter is teetering on the edge of decaying into nothingness, taking you with it.  The only way to have a continued existance is to venture 
out into the world and destroy all the remaining alters, eliminating all other minor gods, and releasing the seal on the one.  Then you must use your possession ability to gain control of 
the one great god itself and rebuild your alter.

In your weakened state, you only have the capacity to possess three mortals.  Once possessed, a mortal remains possessed until they perish.  When a spot has opened up, you
can attempt to possess any other creature you come in contact with.

The weaker the creature is when you attempt to gain possession of them the more likely you are to succeed.  Failing a possession attempt reduces the likelihood that you will be successful
on subsequent attempts.
