Overworld:
- Press M to open the menu
- WASD or Arrow keys move
- You can attack enemies, pickup items, and open doors by running into them

Items:
- Each character can be equipped with items you find around.
- Use the 'Items' menu to equip and use items
- Use the 'Battlers' menu to unequip items
- You can use healing items any time (overworld or battle)
- Equipment can only be changed in the overworld
- Move scrolls can only be changed in the overworld

Battle:
- One combatant is active at a time - this is indicated by a highlighted name
- Only the active combatant gets to attack, but you can change who is currently active without missing a turn.
- When an enemy is defeated, all combatants get exp. but the active combatant gets a slightly higher percentage
- Some moves attack a single enemy (blast, strike) Some attack multiple (wave, rush)
- Some moves have a chance at applying status conditions.  Most of these end after the battle but not all.
- You can run from a battle but the enemy will get a free strike on you.
- Every move has its own MP pool.  When this is drained, you can still try to use the move but there is only a small chance you will be successfull
- The more you use a move, the stronger it becomes
- On levelup some HP and MP is restored along with a general stat boost
- If you don't have a full party and there is only one enemy, you can attempt to possess them, converting them to your team
- If a combatant has 5 or more moves, they will have reduced effectiveness.  Jack of all trades master of none
